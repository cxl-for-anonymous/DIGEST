How do you counter that?\n#Person2#: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n#Person3#: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.",

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n#Person2#: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n#Person3#: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n#Person2#: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n#Person1#: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n#Person2#: You just need to know how to care for them.\n#Person1#: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n#Person2#: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n#Person1#: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n#Person2#: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n#Person1#: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n#Person4#: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n#Person1#: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n#Person2#: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n#Person1#: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n#Person2#: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n#Person1#: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n#Person2#: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick. [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n#Person5#: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet UV bulb ...\n#Person1#: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n#Person2#: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n#Person1#: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n#Person2#: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n#Person1#: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No]. Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n#Person2#: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n#Person1#: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n#Person2#: My pleasure.",

It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan.\n#Person2#: Well, what is the main difference between these cars?\n#Person3#: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you?\n#Person2#: Just me and my son.\n#Person1#: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front.\n#Person2#: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so.\n#Person1#: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway?\n#Person1#: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day.\n#Person2#: Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage?\n#Person1#: Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas.\n#Person2#: Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices.\n#Person1#: Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand.\n#Person2#: Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me.\n#Person1#: Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day.\n#Person2#: I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like?\n#Person1#: Uh, it's right out there in the parking lot. [Which one?] The one over there next to the sidewalk.\n#Person2#: Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap? Ahhh.\n#Person1#: Sir, excuse me. We take pride in our vehicles. It's just that it's one of the last cars on our lot, but it runs like a dream. Don't let the exterior fool you. Hey, I'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers. Will there be any other drivers?\n#Person2#: No, I'm the only driver.\n#Person1#: Okay. Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan?\n#Person2#: What's that exactly?\n#Person1#: Well, the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle, [Okay] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [Oh]. It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ]. However, it won't cover loss of property due to theft. Too much crime in the area anyway. [What? Wh ... What about this crime? What, what?]. Don't worry about it. And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety-five per day. [But you were saying?] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem.\n#Person2#: But wouldn't my own car insurance cover those problems?\n#Person1#: It might, but each insurance policy is different. With our car protection plan, however, you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [Well ... ], and we handle everything quickly, and you don't have to contact your own insurance company. Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door.\n#Person2#: Push it up to the door? I hope this car really runs.\n#Person1#: Well, in case it does break down on some out-of-the-way, deserted road, just call the toll-free number for assistance. They'll come to assist you within ... two business days. [Two business days!!!] Enjoy your trip.",

This university keeps up close relations with some British universities, among which is Oxford University. My university and Oxford have an exchange program. Every year Jiaotong University sends several teachers to Oxford; Oxford sends a few professors to Jiaotong. They go to Jiaotong mostly for a few lectures, staying only a few weeks. The Oxford University supplies Chinese teachers with 810 pounds each month. It is all the money I have to cover all my expenses. Although I do not have much money, I'm still happy that I have the opportunity to study in Britain. Being an English teacher in China, I, of course, do not have to pass the IELTS.\n#Person1#: Finally we want to introduce Mr. Yuan, who is financing his studies out of his own pocket. He wants to graduate in Oxford.\n#Person3#: Neither the Chinese nor the British government is financially supporting me. My parents paid me the flight from Beijing to London. In Britain I have relatives that came to Dover via Hong Kong about ten years ago. They give me 500 pounds each month. That is of course not enough to survive. So I get a part-time job in a Chinese restaurant and earn about 400 or 500 pounds per month. I also had to pass the IELTS in order to study at a British University.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr. Yuan.
