I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry.

One is I usually stay away from anything touristy or where the tourists are because people just assume you're a tourist and nobody will bother to meet you.

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n#Person2#: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n#Person3#: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n#Person2#: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n#Person1#: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n#Person2#: You just need to know how to care for them.\n#Person1#: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n#Person2#: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n#Person1#: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n#Person2#: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n#Person1#: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n#Person4#: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n#Person1#: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n#Person2#: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n#Person1#: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n#Person2#: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n#Person1#: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n#Person2#: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick. [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n#Person5#: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet UV bulb ...\n#Person1#: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n#Person2#: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n#Person1#: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n#Person2#: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n#Person1#: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No]. Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n#Person2#: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n#Person1#: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n#Person2#: My pleasure.",
        "summary": "#Person1# welcomes Joshua to the Exotic Animal Kingdom show. Bearded dragons originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Joshua tells the audience that raising bearded dragons needs to prepare some kind of enclosure, a full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp, branches and rocks, a food or water dish, and something to line the bottom of the cage. Bearded dragons are omnivores and can be fed by insects, vegetables, and greens, the leafy parts of plants, and their stems. People should keep the cage dry. They need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb and ninety to a hundred degrees of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.",
        "response": "In the Exotic Animal Kingdom show, Joshua introduces bearded dragons, originating from Australian deserts and now bred in captivity in the US. Bearded dragons are docile, suitable as family pets, needing an enclosure, specific lighting, climbing objects, and proper bedding. They are omnivores, requiring a diet of insects, vegetables, and greens, with calcium supplements for bone growth. Water needs are met through vegetables and occasional misting, keeping the cage dry to prevent mold and bacteria growth. Full spectrum and basking lights are essential for vitamin production and digestion, with temperatures around 90-100 degrees in the basking area. Direct sunlight can be provided outside, but glass aquariums with sunlight are not a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb, as the glass filters out the necessary sunlight. ",

And me too--I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here. But how can we get it out? Do we need to call helpers?\n#Person1#: Absolutely not. We can remove the carpet ourselves. Carpet is held down with carpet nails. You just need to pull it hard and it comes up. \n#Person2#: Great. Then, after we remove the carpet, we need to restain all the wood floors. Right? \n#Person1#: Yes. But we should hire someone for that. That will probably be expensive. And it has to be done right. \n#Person2#: And then, after the floors are done, we can start to move our furniture in. \n#Person1#: Sure. If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors, we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so. I can get all the carpet out this weekend. \n#Person2#: So, after the floors are done, and after the furniture is in, we need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings. \n#Person1#: I'm the painter. You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains. That will probably be pretty expensive too. Having good curtains made isn't cheap. \n#Person3#: You mean we can't just buy curtains already made? \n#Person2#: Absolutely not. The windows must be measured, and then the curtains need to be made professionally. So that will take a while. Maybe a month or so.\n#Person1#: While the curtains are being made, I can start having people look at the kitchen. I can't stand that old kitchen. I won't be able to cook in there. I don't want to use that electric stove. \n#Person2#: We will need to find an interior decorating company do redo the kitchen. I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation. I will look in the Yellow Pages. I'd like a kitchen of colors.\n#Person1#: I agree. The colors must be soft and pleasant. You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners. \n#Person2#: Me? Cook our dinners? Hah! You will be cooking, dear. You will cook. \n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room. \n#Person2#: Well, I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then. So you won't be able to afford any \n#Person1#: And you'll have to sell your motorcycle. And your cameras. Right? \n#Person2#: Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week. How is that? \n#Person1#: Four times might be enough. Not once or twice. ",
