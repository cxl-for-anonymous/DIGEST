In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n#Person2#: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n#Person3#: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n#Person2#: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n#Person1#: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n#Person2#: You just need to know how to care for them.\n#Person1#: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n#Person2#: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n#Person1#: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n#Person2#: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n#Person1#: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n#Person4#: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n#Person1#: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n#Person2#: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n#Person1#: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n#Person2#: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n#Person1#: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n#Person2#: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick. [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n#Person5#: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet UV bulb ...\n#Person1#: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n#Person2#: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n#Person1#: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n#Person2#: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n#Person1#: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No]. Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n#Person2#: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n#Person1#: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n#Person2#: My pleasure.",
        "golden_summary": "#Person1# welcomes Joshua to the Exotic Animal Kingdom show. Bearded dragons originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Joshua tells the audience that raising bearded dragons needs to prepare some kind of enclosure, a full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp, branches and rocks, a food or water dish, and something to line the bottom of the cage. Bearded dragons are omnivores and can be fed by insects, vegetables, and greens, the leafy parts of plants, and their stems. People should keep the cage dry. They need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb and ninety to a hundred degrees of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.",

It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan.\n#Person2#: Well, what is the main difference between these cars?\n#Person3#: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you?\n#Person2#: Just me and my son.\n#Person1#: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front.\n#Person2#: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so.\n#Person1#: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway?\n#Person1#: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day.\n#Person2#: Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage?\n#Person1#: Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas.\n#Person2#: Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices.\n#Person1#: Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand.\n#Person2#: Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me.\n#Person1#: Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day.\n#Person2#: I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like?\n#Person1#: Uh, it's right out there in the parking lot. [Which one?] The one over there next to the sidewalk.\n#Person2#: Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap? Ahhh.\n#Person1#: Sir, excuse me. We take pride in our vehicles. It's just that it's one of the last cars on our lot, but it runs like a dream. Don't let the exterior fool you. Hey, I'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers. Will there be any other drivers?\n#Person2#: No, I'm the only driver.\n#Person1#: Okay. Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan?\n#Person2#: What's that exactly?\n#Person1#: Well, the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle, [Okay] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [Oh]. It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ]. However, it won't cover loss of property due to theft. Too much crime in the area anyway. [What? Wh ... What about this crime? What, what?]. Don't worry about it. And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety-five per day. [But you were saying?] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem.\n#Person2#: But wouldn't my own car insurance cover those problems?\n#Person1#: It might, but each insurance policy is different. With our car protection plan, however, you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [Well ... ], and we handle everything quickly, and you don't have to contact your own insurance company. Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door.\n#Person2#: Push it up to the door? I hope this car really runs.\n#Person1#: Well, in case it does break down on some out-of-the-way, deserted road, just call the toll-free number for assistance. They'll come to assist you within ... two business days. [Two business days!!!] Enjoy your trip.",

How does that work? \n#Person2#: Usually you meet lots of people but there's a couple of things you need to do. One is I usually stay away from anything touristy or where the tourists are because people just assume you're a tourist and nobody will bother to meet you. The best place to meet people though is a gym. So in every city, I would go to, I would sign up for a gym for two weeks or one month and you always meet people there. So gyms are great, you meet people right after work. You kind of feel like you're in a normal work flow. Parks, you meet a lot of people in parks. You go to where the local people are, maybe a food court or libraries, stuff like that, so usually places where people are actually trying to do something productive, either study or exercise or whatever, you meet people. \n#Person1#: That was going to be my next question. What about your health? How do you maintain a health when you're living that kind of. . . \n#Person2#: Well, yeah, you gotta eat well and you gotta exercise. I did go to the hospital in Chiang Mai because a dog bit me. Yeah. \n#Person1#: Oh, no. Did you have to get rabies shots? \n#Person3#: I had to get a rabies shot and it was really cheap so in most countries healthcare is really cheap. Thailand healthcare is excellent, I mean absolutely fantastic. And you know Vietnam it's cheap. You know even in big places like Taiwan or Korea, you know, you'd be surprised like it's not that expensive. You just got to go to the hospital and they'll sew you up. \n#Person1#: And language problems? Did you ever have any language issues? \n#Person2#: No, usually not. I mean like I lived in Thailand for four years so I can speak Thai but like Taiwan everybody spoke really good English. I went to Korea, didn't know a word of Korean. I stayed there for six weeks working from there and everybody was so nice. A lot of gestures so I got by and actually I remember getting on the plane to go home from Korea and I realized I didn't know even how to say yes and no in Korean or one, two, three, four, five and I was in their country for five weeks, six weeks. So, yeah, the Koreans were very nice. \n#Person1#: Good. \n#Person2#: So have I sold you? Would you like to give it a try? \n#Person1#: Yes, I would but I, my problem is like motivation. Like if I'm not given a schedule, if I don't have deadlines, if it's all up to me, I, you know, I'd just spend all day at the beach and go for a massage, maybe do some shopping, go to a club, or something. I can't see myself working when I feel like I'm traveling and on holiday. I don't know. \n#Person2#: Yeah, that's the catch. \n#Person1#: The mindset, I guess yeah. \n#Person2#: Yeah, that's the hard part. ",

If we do the floors first, and then paint the walls, we will get paint all over our new floor. \n#Person1#: Hmm. Maybe you're right. But I can't stand all this green carpet in here. And besides, I know how to paint. I will just cover everything with drop cloth. I won't get anything on the floor. \n#Person2#: Are you sure? \n#Person1#: Yes, I'm sure. I've done a lot of house painting in my life. And my mother was very picky. If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture, she would get furious. So I learned to be very careful.\n#Person2#: Alright. Then maybe we can do the floor first. These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful. And me too--I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here. But how can we get it out? Do we need to call helpers?\n#Person1#: Absolutely not. We can remove the carpet ourselves. Carpet is held down with carpet nails. You just need to pull it hard and it comes up. \n#Person2#: Great. Then, after we remove the carpet, we need to restain all the wood floors. Right? \n#Person1#: Yes. But we should hire someone for that. That will probably be expensive. And it has to be done right. \n#Person2#: And then, after the floors are done, we can start to move our furniture in. \n#Person1#: Sure. If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors, we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so. I can get all the carpet out this weekend. \n#Person2#: So, after the floors are done, and after the furniture is in, we need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings. \n#Person1#: I'm the painter. You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains. That will probably be pretty expensive too. Having good curtains made isn't cheap. \n#Person3#: You mean we can't just buy curtains already made? \n#Person2#: Absolutely not. The windows must be measured, and then the curtains need to be made professionally. So that will take a while. Maybe a month or so.\n#Person1#: While the curtains are being made, I can start having people look at the kitchen. I can't stand that old kitchen. I won't be able to cook in there. I don't want to use that electric stove. \n#Person2#: We will need to find an interior decorating company do redo the kitchen. I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation. I will look in the Yellow Pages. I'd like a kitchen of colors.\n#Person1#: I agree. The colors must be soft and pleasant. You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners. \n#Person2#: Me? Cook our dinners? Hah! You will be cooking, dear. You will cook. \n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room. \n#Person2#: Well, I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then. So you won't be able to afford any \n#Person1#: And you'll have to sell your motorcycle.
